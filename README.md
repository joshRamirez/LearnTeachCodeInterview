# LearnTeachCodeInterview
Learn Teach Code Interview Problem Meetup Solution

We can use this for pushing all our code:
  1. Create a directory of the language you coded your solution if it doesn't already exist. 
  2. Give a short name to file(short description of the problem you solved) and have your name. 
     Eg: PermutationPritam.java
  3. Push your code :).
